# SeniorSeminar
 Senior Seminar Project for Dr. Zhong

## Description
 In this project we implement Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort.
 After we implement our three sorting algorithms, we create a method to run individual timing experiments on these methods.
 After we create a method to run an individual timing experiment on these methods, we create a method to run group experiments to find averages for each individual algorithm.
